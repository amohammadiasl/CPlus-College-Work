In this project, I have a matrix of strings that I worked with
This was the first project done tat utilized a linked list
There are 5 words that have 5 letters in them each 
There are 4 functions in this code:
    1) Interchanging column number one with column number 4
    2) Counting and returning the total number of vowels in the words. 
    3) Dispplaying the array in the form of a matrix
    4) Taking in a specific letter, and returning the amount og times that letter appears
