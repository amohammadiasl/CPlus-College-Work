In this mini project I tried to use a queue to form a line for a restaurant <br> 
Multiple different void methods were implemented and called upon in different places <br>
You can add names to the queue and they will be added to the queue <br>
You can count the amount of people in the queue <br>
After adding each person to the queue, they are given a raffle number; once the raffle is drawn, an RNG is used to pick a winner <br>
Lastly, you can display the line to see the order of people. <br>
&nbsp; You will also be able to view the order that the names were entered into the queue and also the current order that they are in
