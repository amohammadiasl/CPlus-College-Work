In this mini project I tried to use a queue to form a line for a restaurant
Multiple different void methods were implemented and called upon in different places
You can add names to the queue and they will be added to the queue
You can count the amount of people in the queue
After adding each person to the queue, they are given a raffle number; once the raffle is drawn, an RNG is used to pick a winner
Lastly, you can display the line to see the order of people.
    You will also be able to view the order that the names were entered into the queue and also the current order that they are in
