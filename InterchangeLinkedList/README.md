In this project, I have a matrix of strings that I worked with <br>
This was the first project done tat utilized a linked list <br>
There are 5 words that have 5 letters in them each <br>
There are 4 functions in this code: <br>
&nbsp;    1) Interchanging column number one with column number 4 <br>
&nbsp;    2) Counting and returning the total number of vowels in the words. <br>
&nbsp;    3) Dispplaying the array in the form of a matrix <br>
&nbsp;    4) Taking in a specific letter, and returning the amount og times that letter appears<br>
